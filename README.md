### This is my Testbed for my Flask Apps!

The goal of this application is for me to test things on a personal Flask 
app before I commit to production codebases. It also houses some 
applications I would like to run for my own personal use.
 
 

##Todo
1. CSS iffy things
2. Create RESTful API (without flask-restful)
3. Create a blog without tutorials
4. Create sphinx documentation
5. Comment all the things
6. Re-structure things regularly (if it makes sense to do so)
